## Summary of Work

This project was completed as part of capstone at IIT Bombay.

- Designed a 6 DoF bipedal robot with servo actuation, optimized link lengths by characterizing human anthropometry
- Integrated I2C communication to command 6 servos at a fixed rate using a timer, producing synchronous motion
- Modelled free-body IK, minimum span trajectories, and constrained control space to generate joint-space gait signals

### Mechanical Design

![](/images/portfolio/biped.png)

## Overview  
**sEnVision** is a 6-degree-of-freedom bipedal robot designed to replicate **human-like gait** using low-cost, accessible components.

## System Design  

The robot features **six actuated joints** forming a kinematic chain mimicking human motion.  

**Main Components:**  
- **Material:** PLA (3D printed) — lightweight, rigid, and recyclable  
- **Actuators:** MG995 servo motors (1.2 Nm torque)  
- **Electronics:** Arduino Uno + PCA9685 servo driver  
- **Power Supply:** 12V 4500mAh battery  
- **Control Logic:** Time-based trajectory interpolation for gait execution  

## Mechanics & Kinematics  

The design uses **seven links** — feet, shins, thighs, and torso — connected through revolute joints to simulate natural motion.  

The robot’s equations of motion were derived using the **Lagrangian method**, relating joint torques and forces.  
Torque analysis confirmed that MG995 servos were sufficient for the robot’s motion requirements.

## Gait Trajectory  

The gait cycle follows human-like **stance** and **swing** phases:  

1. **Stance Phase** – foot contacts the ground, supporting body weight.  
2. **Swing Phase** – opposite leg moves forward for the next step.  

Linear interpolation between joint angles ensures continuous, natural transitions between postures.


## Simulation & Hardware Implementation  

The gait trajectory was simulated using **MATLAB**, allowing fine-tuning through a custom GUI.  
Hardware implementation used **Arduino Uno** with timed interrupts for synchronized servo motion.

## Results  

- Achieved smooth and stable walking gait  
- Verified torque feasibility through dynamic modeling  
- Observed minimal jitter in servo movement  
- Lateral sway aided natural balancing  

The robot demonstrated **stable locomotion** and effective human-like gait under constrained conditions.
