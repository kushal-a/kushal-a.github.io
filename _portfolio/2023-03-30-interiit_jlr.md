## Summary of Work
Robotics Problem Statement sponsored by Jaguar land Rover as part of InterIIT Tech Competititon 11.0
Part of a 15-member team, secured a silver medal for outstanding solution among 23 IITs and 4th position overall
- Designed a 5 DoF planar robotic arm with direct vertical actuation for plugging in EV chargers into car sockets 
- Characterized a cuboidal workspace in MATLAB with manipulator kinematics to optimize link lengths for reachability
- Formulated 6 sub-tasks and calculated trajectories using an optimal controller to minimize energy consumption
