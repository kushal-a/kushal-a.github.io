## Overview 
This project explores **attitude control** through the design and implementation of a **1D balancing robot**. The project combines **mechanical design**, **control theory**, and **embedded systems** to achieve real-time stability. This project was motivated at developing a teaching platform for control systems. It was guided by Prof. Vivek Sangwan and completed as a part of my Bachelor's Thesis at IIT Bombay. 



## Control Algorithm  
A **PD controller** was developed to regulate the angle of the bot, using real-time IMU feedback.  

The key highlights of the controller includes:  
- **Saturation functions** to prevent infeasible thrust commands  
- **Power optimization** to reduce unnecessary energy use  
- **Stability filtering** ensuring continuous operation within safe regions  

## Simulation & Testing  
Simulations validated the control algorithm for setpoint and sinusoidal trajectory tracking. A **static thrust test** characterized motor-propeller performance, showing up to **500g thrust** with 1045 propellers. Final implementation used **8045** props for safer operation.

## Mechanical Design
The bot was modeled as a two-link structure pivoting about a single contact point.  

**Key Components:**  
- **Frame:** Aluminum 2020T profiles — lightweight and rigid  
- **Contact Surface:** Rubber-coated cylinder for friction and vibration damping  
- **Actuation:** Dual BLDC motors with propellers providing differential thrust  
- **Electronics:** Teensy 4.1 microcontroller, MPU6050 IMU, SimonK 30A ESCs  
- **Power:** External regulated supply for classroom safety and consistency  

All components were designed in **SolidWorks**, and custom mounts were **3D-printed** using PLA and laser-cut acrylic.
