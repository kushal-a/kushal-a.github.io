## Summary of Work


- Fabricated a 2 DoF robotic device with a modular sensor interface to record spatial distribution of temperature and UV exposure with mm-level precision in masked resin 3D printing devices
- Modeled intrinsic photo-mechano-chemical processes and evaluated using recorded data, deriving 5 model parameters
- Devised a model-based controller to compensate for side processes, enabling finer control in printed graded structures
