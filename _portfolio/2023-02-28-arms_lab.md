## Summary of Work
- Explored usage of ROS for simulation of navigation and control of a 6 DoF Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) and marginal benefit from substituting 3D LiDARs with 2D LiDARs and the use of sonars for seabed exploration
- Implemented potential function in formulating a control law with switching states stability algorithm to simulate global homing feature of a swarm of robots characterized with collision avoidance
- Utilized Deep Learning algorithms to identify & classify objects, vehicles & pedestrians using 2D-Lidar from a vehicle
