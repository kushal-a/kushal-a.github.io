Summer internship completed at [Systemantics India](https://www.systemantics.com/) in 2023.

- Formulated a momentum observer capable of running in a real-time process, calculating external forces and detecting collisions, enabling kinesthetic learning and operational safety features in a collaborative robotic manipulator
- Designed robot features to be joint-agnostic and programmed in C using RTOS, ensuring reliable and smooth control 
- Constructed a ROS-Gazebo simulation environment for a robot arm, allowing faster feature testing and debugging
