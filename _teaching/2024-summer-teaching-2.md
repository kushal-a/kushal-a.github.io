Served as teaching assistant under [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) for the course [Design of Mechatronic Systems](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/112101304) with over 2000 students. The course was offered in partnership with [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/), a government-sponsored MOOC platform. As a TA, I designed assignments, question papers, and practice problems. My questions always highlighted various mechatronic applications, teaching students content beyond regular problem solving.
