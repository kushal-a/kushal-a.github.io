I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing Masters of Science in Robotic Systems Development. I am open to work on fast-paced projects which are interdisciplinary in nature and have high impact potential.

I pursued my undergraduate from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with a major in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Systems and Controls Engineering. During my undergraduate I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Vivek Sangwan and Prof. Prasanna Gandhi. I was also a member of the IIT Bombay Mars Rover Team, developing mechanical solutions for Martian rovers.

## Research Interest

I am motivated by working across borders of traditional engineering domains. I have a stark interest in robotics. More specifically, I want to work build fully autonomous robots that work collaboratively with humans, have high agility of motion, capable of quick decision making as well as long-term planning and have the ability to make high impact in our society.
