I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing Masters of Science in Robotic Systems Development. I am interested in mobile manipulators and legged robots. My areas of expertise are Control Systems, ROS, Robotic Simulation, Embedded Development and Computer-Aided Design. I am currently pushing frontiers for Computer Vision using learning based methods.

I pursued my undergraduate from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with a major in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Systems and Controls Engineering. During my undergraduate I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Vivek Sangwan](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/faculty/prof-vivek-sangwan) and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/). I was also a member of the IIT Bombay Mars Rover Team, developing mechanical solutions for Martian rovers.

## Research Interest

<ul>
  <li>[Robot Pose Estimation using only RGB stream]()</li>
  <li>[General indoor navigation for humanoids and all mobile manipulators]()</li>
</ul>

## For Recruiters

I am looking for an internship for the Summer of 2026. I want to work on computer vision applications in robotics. I am also open to work on robotic controls and robot learning. Below is a summary of experiences that would be relevant to the roles I am looking for.
